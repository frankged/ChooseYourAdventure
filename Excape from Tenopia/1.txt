You are about to find yourself trapped on a strange
and dangerous island on one of the most forbidding
planets in the galaxy: Tenopia. lt's important that you
follow the directions in this book if you hope to escape!
During your travels on Tenopia lsland, you'll have
a
small computer that can project a map of the region
you're in at any moment. To use this, flip to the map
page indicated near the bottom of the page you're
reading. (When you turn to a map page, be sure to
keep a finger on the page you're reading so you
won't lose your place.)
Whether or not you escape from Tenopia Island will
depend on how skillful you are, how persistent you
are, and how lucky you are. Will you succeed-or will
you be trapped Iorever? lt's entirely up to you!

While you are lraveling on a diplomatic mission
from Earth to the Mylaean Cluster, your spaceship is
hit by a meleor. With seconds lo spare, you jettison in
an escape pod, the only survivor. The pod's buih-in
computer indicates there is only enough fuel to reach
Tenopia, the fifth planet of Star Sysiem Tenopia. The
compuler's memory bank supplies you with ihe following information:
TENOPIA: a/s Earlh size; rotation 26 hours;
sun rises in the east, sets in wesl; revolution
587 days; air quality excellent; food and waler abundant; surface 80% ocean with one
large island (Tbnopia lsland) and a single
continent (Kabran); ocean is subject to violent storms; galaclic language widely spoken; technology generally medieval; travel
dangerous and not advised.
Bracing yourself for entry into Tenopia's atmosphere, you examine your only survival equipmenta pocket-sized computer ihat is programmed to
project a map of your region at all times on a small
video screen.
Suddenly, on the pod's computer, you read:
Entry Phase: landing targeted near Krelia,
west coast of Tenopia lsland.
A momenl later the words "tnopia lsland" appear, and this aerial viau is displayed:

Your tiny craft sets down with a sharp jolt. You lie
dazedlor a few minutes before you can pullyourself
together. By the time you crawl through the hatch,
your pod is already surrounded by giani half-human
creatures with huge forked hands. They blindfold you
and lead you along a winding bumpy surface, then
down a long ladder thai leads deep underground. At
last they remove your blindfold. You are in a huge
dimly lit cavern that reeks of sulfurous fumes.
The creatures search you. You hold your breath
when they find your computer. But they toss it aside
as a useless ornament, and you're able to relrieve it
a
few moments later.
You quickly learn that your captors are crogocides
and thdi you have been condemned to slavery in their
krelium mine. Closely watched by crogocide guards
wielding long spiked sticks, you are forced to chip
and shovel krelium ore for seven hours before you're
allowed to resi for the night.
Most of the slaves speak the galactic language, and
during the days that follow you make friends with
Prespar, an old hominid from a nearby planet. He
looks almost as human as yourself.
When you ask whether there is any hope of escape
from the mine, Prespar merely shakes his head. But
that night, while lhere are no crogocides nearby, he
comes to you and whispers, "There is a secret tunnel
that leads lo the surface. Tomorrow I will show you
the slab that hides the entrance."
"How do I get to the nearest galactic patrol station?" you whisper back.
